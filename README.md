By using Natural Language Processing and other cool stuff, I would like to process Yelp reviews. In this project, I am going to figure out how to process text, how turn text into vectors, and how to model topics from documents. Apply skills to NLP datasets out there: Yelp.

The real dataset is massive (almost 8 gigs uncompressed). The data is sampled to something more manageable. As I work on the project, I also add comments and conclusions about my findings and describe anything I want to analyze in the future.
